{"name":"Anon10W1z","tagline":"Minecraft mod creator, programmer, and sports guru","body":"### About Me\r\nI'm a 14-year-old kid living the life of his dreams in the Bay Area. Whatever I do, I strive to do it cleanly, efficiently, and the best that I can. Whenever I feel like quitting a task, whether it be a programming challenge or a basketball drill, I always remember that once you get tired, that's when the real hard work starts.\r\n\r\n### My Projects\r\n- [Craft++](https://anon10w1z.github.io/CraftPlusPlus/): A simple Minecraft mod that enhances vanilla Minecraft.\r\n- [AnonLang](https://anon10w1z.github.io/AnonLang/): A \"programming language\" of sorts that allows you to write simple programs. It features integers, doubles, strings, repeat loops, global variables, and more.\r\n\r\n### Sports\r\nFor a few years now, sports has been a big part of my life. The main sport I follow is basketball, as a fan of the 2015 NBA Champions, the Golden State Warriors, since 2012. Sports can teach you so many values, from teamwork to perseverance, and I encourage anyone and everyone to pick it up in some way. Sports also keep you active and help you lead a healthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\n### Contact Info\r\nThere are plenty of places to contact me! I am available on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Anon10W1z), the [Minecraft Forums](http://www.minecraftforum.net/members/Anon10W1z), and the [Minecraft Forge Forums](http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=66202).","google":"UA-64535980-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
