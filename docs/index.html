<p>Welcome to Vanilla Tweaks's website! This website contains the latest downloads, information, and more for Vanilla Tweaks. Feel free to take a look around! Note that downloads for the compiled mod can be found below; the buttons on the right will give you the source code, not a useable mod!</p>

<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Vanilla Tweaks is a Minecraft Multi-Version mod designed to enhance vanilla Minecraft without going overboard. It is designed to be minimally invasive and configurable to create a user experience like none other.</p>

<h3>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p>Vanilla Tweaks adds a multitude of features to enhance your world.</p>

<ul>
<li>Several new enchantments!

<ul>
<li>Nimble and Hops: These enchantments go on your boots, and can go all the way up to level 3. Each level adds a bit to your movement speed and jump height, respectively.</li>
<li>Vigor: Goes on your chestplate. It will grant the wearer a one heart max health increase per enchantment level, maximum of 3.</li>
<li>Veteran: Goes on your head, instantly increasing your knowledge! It will attract all experience orbs in a 32-block radius towards you!</li>
<li>Siphon: All mined block drops instantly go into your inventory! You won't have to deal with a pesky zombie or friend stealing your freshly-mined diamonds again! It is friendly with Silk Touch and Blazing.</li>
<li>Homing: Your arrows will aim right at your target. Level 1 works for entities 32 blocks away, level 2 works for entities 64 blocks away, and level 3 128 blocks away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New items!

<ul>
<li>Dynamite: Simple throwable TNT! It is crafted out of a string on the top, a sand directly below that, and a piece of gunpowder below that and to the left. You can also dispense it out of a dispenser! It won't work when wet, either by rain or water. Credits to TooMuchTNT, made by MinecraftTNTstuff, for the texture.(Doesnt currently work)</li>
<li>Fried Egg: Simply toss an egg in the furnace to produce it! It will heal 2.5 hunger bars.</li>
<li>Binocular Lens: A crafting ingredient for binoculars. See above for the crafting recipe picture.</li>
<li>Binoculars: A non-OP way to zoom! See above for the crafting recipe. The amount of zoom is configurable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Storage blocks for flint, sugar, and charcoal. Charcoal blocks can be used like coal blocks, and sugar blocks fall like sand. Credits to Minestrappolation for the textures (IIRC).</li>
<li>Nether is  Less Dangerous as there are no is Lava Pockets</li>
<li>A new way to show off your treasure. A Pedestal!!</li>
<li>Enhanced mob drops!

<ul>
<li>Named mobs will drop their name tags.</li>
<li>Bats drop leather</li>
<li>Endermen drop their held blocks.</li>
<li>Creepers have a 1/10 chance of dropping a TNT block.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More realistic predator/prey relationships! When ocelots kill chickens, the chickens won't drop meat! Same for wolves and sheep!</li>
<li>Seeds will plant themselves after a (randomly-determined) couple of seconds delay. Farms can now be more easily automated!</li>
<li>Mob Spawners drop themselves when you use silk touch</li>
<li>Command blocks can be found in the redstone creative tab. Dragon eggs can be found in the decorations tab.</li>
<li>Buttons are named according to their material! (E.g. stone/wooden buttons)</li>
<li>Crafting buttons gives you 4 rather than 1.</li>
<li>Potion and enchantment level roman numerals now are localized up to level 255.</li>
<li>Wool can be back-crafted into 4 string.</li>

<p>Vanilla Tweaks is extremely configurable. Everything from enabling and disabling enchantments to automatic seed planting can be configured straight from the config GUI, accessible from the mods menu or the game menu. It is advised to delete your config file every time you update Vanilla Tweaks, for the configuration options may have changed.</p>
